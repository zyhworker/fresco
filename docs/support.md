## Fresco Support

**Fresco** is worked on by Facebook Android engineers. They're often around and available for questions.

The [GitHub issues](https://github.com/facebook/fresco/issues) page is the best place to ask questions, find answers, and report issues.

## How to get help

When you report an issue on GitHub, the more information the better. Here are some things that will help you get an answer faster:

- A screenshot or video of the problem
- A snippet of the code in question
- Logcat output, if your app is crashing.
- The format of the affected images (JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP)
- Whether the image is an animation
- Where the images are coming from - network, local file, content provider, asset, or resource.
